conways-game-of-life
====================

A TDD approach to Conway's Game of Life.



General Game Rules:

    -Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.

    -Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

    -Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.

    -Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Other Details:

The game is set on a 2-d grid system, where each square in the grid represents a cell.  This version is implemented using command-line characters only.

Alive cells are represented by:  "X"

Dead cells are represented by: "0"
